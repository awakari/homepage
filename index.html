          <p class="ui-text-intro">
            Conventional search is used to find an important information by a query.
            The problem is reverse in the modern world of real-time message streams.
            It's necessary to filter and consume messages matching a query on the fly.
            Existing messaging solutions offer only "channels" or "topics" for this.
            Nevertheless, these tend to contain tons of irrelevant information.
          </p>
          <p class="ui-text-intro">
            Awakari comes to solve this problem by using flexible subscriptions instead of channels.
